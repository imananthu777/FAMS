You are a senior full-stack engineer.

Build a fully working Fixed Asset Management demo web application
that works on both desktop and mobile screens, with an iOS-style UI,
and uses Excel files as the backend database (no real authentication services).

This app is for top-management demonstration, so it must look
production-grade but remain simple, safe, and editable.

========================
TECH STACK (MANDATORY)
========================
Frontend:
- React
- Ionic React (force iOS mode UI)
- Ionicons
- Mobile-first responsive layout

Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- ExcelJS for reading/writing Excel
- node-cron for automation

No external authentication systems.
No real email servers (simulate notifications).

========================
DATA SOURCE
========================
Use Excel files stored in /data folder as the ONLY database.
All UI actions must read/write to Excel.

Excel files:
- assets.xlsx
- users.xlsx
- branches.xlsx
- approvals.xlsx
- gatepass.xlsx
- reconciliation.xlsx
- audit_log.xlsx

Excel is the single source of truth.
Editing Excel should reflect immediately in UI.

========================
ROLES (SIMULATED LOGIN)
========================
Login page should allow selecting a user from users.xlsx.
Role is auto-detected.

Roles:
1. Branch User (Admin SPOC)
2. Manager
3. Admin

========================
CORE ASSET FIELDS
========================
Each asset must include:
- Asset Name
- Asset Type
- Tag Number (unique)
- Date of Purchase
- Warranty End Date
- AMC Start Date
- AMC End Date
- Asset Expiry Date
- Depreciation Method
- Depreciation %
- Closing Depreciation Value
- Branch Name
- Branch Code
- Branch User
- Asset Status (Active / Disposal)
- Mapped Employee Code (optional)

========================
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
========================

1. DASHBOARD (ACTIONABLE FIRST)
- Cards for:
  - Assets expiring within 30 days
  - AMC due
  - Disposal in progress
  - New assets added
  - Monthly reconciliation pending
- Clicking a card filters asset list

2. ASSET MANAGEMENT
- View all assets based on role scope
- Add / Edit / View assets
- Excel updated instantly

3. ASSET ASSIGNMENT WORKFLOW
- Branch User assigns asset to employee
- Status = Pending Approval
- Admin approves or rejects
- If rejected → asset auto-assigned back to Branch User

4. EXPIRY & AMC AUTOMATION
- Daily cron check
- If expiry or AMC ≤ 30 days:
  - Show dashboard alert
  - Log notification (simulate email)

5. DISPOSAL FLOW
- Branch initiates disposal
- Admin approves
- Status becomes Disposal
- Disposed assets are read-only

6. TRANSFER & GATE PASS
- Branch-to-branch asset transfer
- Auto generate Gate Pass ID
- Save to gatepass.xlsx
- Allow PDF download

7. MONTHLY RECONCILIATION
- System generates reconciliation entry
- Branch User digitally accepts
- Saved to reconciliation.xlsx
- Logged in audit_log.xlsx

8. AUTO-REASSIGNMENT RULE
If a mapped employee becomes inactive:
- Asset must be auto-unmapped
- Branch User becomes custodian

9. MANAGER FEATURES
- View multiple branches
- Skip-level overview
- Emergency takeover of branch actions
- Delegate branch SPOC temporarily

10. ADMIN FEATURES
- Global dashboard
- Approve all actions
- Add / dispose assets
- Manage branch users

========================
UI REQUIREMENTS
========================
- iOS-style cards, lists, modals
- Bottom tab navigation for mobile
- Sidebar navigation for desktop
- Clean Apple-like design
- Fast, smooth transitions

========================
AUDIT & LOGGING
========================
Every action must write to audit_log.xlsx with:
- Timestamp
- User
- Action
- Asset ID
- Remarks

========================
PROJECT STRUCTURE
========================
Create:
- frontend/ (React + Ionic)
- backend/ (Node + Express)
- data/ (Excel files)

========================
OUTPUT EXPECTATION
========================
Generate:
1. Complete project folder structure
2. Backend APIs with Excel read/write
3. Frontend screens wired to APIs
4. Sample Excel templates
5. Clear instructions to run the app in Replit

This must be runnable immediately after installation.
Do NOT leave placeholders or TODOs.
